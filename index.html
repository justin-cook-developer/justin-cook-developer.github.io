                            <p class="paragraph">I'll come right out and say it, I <strong>love</strong> to code. I thoroughly enjoy the analytical thinking that coding requires, the grind of fixing bugs, and the sweet success of a working program. 
                                My passion for the act of coding itself is complemented by my desire to create something impactful, and valuable to society. Thus, web programming is the perfect medium with which to make my mark, and is a career in which I know I can thrive!
                                Now that you have an idea of my motives for attending Fullstack at SLO, I'll back track and explain how I've gotten to where I am today.

                            <p class="paragraph">My first two years of high school were nothing special. I was a typical high school student, unengaged in my studies, and more interested in <a href="https://youtu.be/hjeQK0c5Uk0" target="_blank">downhill skateboarding</a> (click the link for a video of me skateboarding) and scuba diving than my education. However, this changed in my junior year. 
                                In what I attribute to amazing educators, heightened extracurricular participation, and a healthy amount of jealousy for my peers who were succeeding, I began to excel in school. As time passed, I became a much better student and a leader in my spheres of interest.

                            <p class="paragraph">With my newfound drive and a taste for success, I dove right into my college coursework at Cuesta and took two classes the summer after graduating from high school. In that semester and subsequent semesters I primarily explored different STEM fields in search of a college major.
                                During my spring semester I suffered a serious knee injury. At the time I was applying to the Air Force Academy, and the injury devastated me. However, it was a blessing in disguise because being couch ridden allowed me to dive deep into programming, sparking my passion for coding.

                            <p class="paragraph">This summer has been nothing but a hustle. A very enjoyable hustle, I must add. I was originally enrolled in college courses at the beginning of summer, but I withdrew when I discovered Fullstack at SLO. Since learning of Fullstack at SLO, I have dove even deeper into coding. After studying for a couple of months, I have now been accepted into Fullstack Academy, 
                                and I am continuing to prepare for the bootcamp to the best of my abilities. I would like to work as a backend engineer, so I am focusing my studies on Javascript and computer science fundamentals. I have also maintained employment at <a href="http://www.moondoggiesbeachclub.com/about-us" target="_blank">Moondoggies Beach Club</a>.

                            <p class="paragraph">Now that you know how I ended up pursuing Fullstack at SLO, I'd like you to know why I would be the best representative for Ticket Into Tech's alternative pathway for recent high school graduates.

                            <p class="paragraph">
                            First and foremost, I am extremely passionate about coding. Passion is a paramount component of excelling at any activity, and I have the requisite passion to keep learning and working hard.
                            Furthermore, I have cultivated an extremely strong work ethic and the self-discipline to complement it. I am rarely the smartest person in the room, but I make up for any innate disadvantages by working harder than anybody else. I am hungry for success, and I have no problem putting in the hours to achieve success. 
                            This has served me very well in my academics and extracurriculars, and I believe it will also serve me well in a professional setting. In addition, I am also an effective collaborator. I have been a part of many successful teams, and I have even lead a few successful projects myself, such as the sustainable seafood video above.

                            to show that tech apprenticeships are a viable, alternative path to success.
